# othello

- Playing a game of Othello (Reversi) with deep-learning network agent.

- The network structure and Monte Carlo tree search algorithm mimicks that of AlphaGo.

- This program needs 'pygame', 'numpy', 'pickle' from PYPI.

- This program does not use the known machine learning framework such as tensorflow, but it uses the python files adopted and modified from the book 'Deep Learning from Scratch' by Saito Goki.

- I also adopted and modified python files of othello game from the book 'Invent your own computer game with python' by Al Sweigart.
