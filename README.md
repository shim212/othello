# othello

- Playing a game of Othello (Reversi) with deep-learning network agent.
- The network mimicks that of Alphago Zero.

- This program needs 'pygame', 'numpy', 'pickle' from PYPI.

- This program does not use the tensorflow, et al., but it uses the python files adopted and modified from the book 'Deep Learning from Scratch' by Saito Goki.
- I also adopted and modified python files of othello game from the book 'Invent your own computer game with python' by Al Sweigart.
