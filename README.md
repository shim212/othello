# othello

* Playing a game of Othello (Reversi) with deep-learning network agent.

- This program needs 'pygame', 'numpy' from PYPI.

* I couldn't add the sub-folder and some accessary files yet.

- This program does not use the tensorflow, et al., but it uses the python files adopted from the book 'The Deep Learning from Scratch'.
